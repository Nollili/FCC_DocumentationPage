                    C# language
                    C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it's also simple and easy to learn. The curly brace syntax of C#
                    will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++, Java or JavaScript. Developers who
                    know
                    any of these languages are typically able to work productively in C# within a short time. C#
                    provides
                    powerful features such as nullable types, delegates, lambda expressions, pattern matching, and safe
                    direct memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and
                    performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom
                    behaviors for client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly typed
                    query a
                    first-class language construct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and
                    polymorphism. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of
                    interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as
                    a
                    way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it's a
                    stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but doesn't support inheritance. C# also provides
                    records, which are class types whose purpose is primarily storing data values.

                    C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a
                    unified set of class libraries. The CLR is the commercial implementation by Microsoft of the common
                    language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating
                    execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI
                    specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly,
                    typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about
                    the assembly's types, version, and culture.

                <p>
                    The "Hello, World" program starts with a <code>using</code> directive that references the
                    <code>System</code> namespace.
                    Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain
                    types and other namespaces—for example, the <code>System</code> namespace contains a number of
                    types, such as the
                    <code>Console</code> class referenced in the program, and a number of other namespaces, such as
                    <code>IO</code> and
                    <code>Collections</code> . A <code>using</code> directive that references a given namespace enables
                    unqualified use of the
                    types that are members of that namespace. Because of the <code>using</code> directive, the program
                    can use
                    <code>Console.WriteLine</code> as shorthand for System.Console.WriteLine.

                    There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. Variables of value types
                    directly contain their data whereas variables of reference types store references to their data, the
                    latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible for two variables to reference
                    the same object and possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the
                    other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it isn't
                    possible for operations on one to affect the other (except for <code>ref</code> and <code>out</code>
                    parameter variables).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of unicode characters without any
                    whitespace. An identifier may be a C# reserved word, if it is prefixed by @. That can be useful when
                    interacting with other languages. <br>
                    C#'s value types are further divided into simple types, enum types, struct types, nullable value
                    types and tuple value types. C#'s reference types are further divided into class types, interface
                    types, array types, and delegate types.

                    The key organizational concepts in C# are programs, namespaces, types, members, and assemblies.
                    Programs declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes,
                    structs, and interfaces are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples
                    of members. When C# programs are compiled, they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies
                    typically have the file extension .exe or .dll, depending on whether they implement applications or
                    libraries, respectively.
                    <br>
                    As a small example, consider an assembly that contains the following code:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    using System;

    namespace Acme.Collections
    {
        public class Stack<T>
        {
            Entry _top;
                                
            public void Push(T data)
            {
                _top = new Entry(_top, data);
            }
                        
            public T Pop()
            {
                if (_top == null)
                {
                    throw new InvalidOperationException();
                }
                T result = _top.Data;
                _top = _top.Next;
                                    
                eturn result;
            }
                        
            class Entry
            {
                public Entry Next { get; set; }
                public T Data { get; set; }
                                    
                public Entry(Entry next, T data)
                {
                    Next = next;
                    Data = data;
                }
            }
        }
    }

                <p>
                    Classes are the most fundamental of C#’s types. A class is a data structure that combines state
                    (fields) and actions (methods and other function members) in a single unit. A class provides a
                    definition for instances of the class, also known as objects. Classes support inheritance and
                    polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes.
                    <br>
                    New classes are created using class declarations. A class declaration starts with a header. The
                    header specifies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attributes and modifiers of the class</li>
                    <li>The name of the class</li>
                    <li>The base class (when inheriting from a base class)</li>
                    <li>The interfaces implemented by the class.</li>
                </ul>
